Project Title: EV3 Robot Solution for Future Engineers
Description
This project outlines the design and implementation of a robot using the LEGO EV3 platform for the Future Engineers competition. The robot is engineered to efficiently navigate and complete various tasks on the competition field. Utilizing a combination of two large motors, two color sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor, the robot is capable of autonomous movement, obstacle detection, and color recognition.

Components
Motors:

Two Large Motors (Motor A & B): These motors are the primary means of propulsion for the robot. They are attached to the robot's wheels, allowing it to move forward, backward, and turn. The large motors are chosen for their strength and torque, enabling the robot to traverse various terrains and obstacles encountered during the competition.
Sensors:

Two Color Sensors (Sensor 1 & 2): Positioned at the front and sides of the robot, these sensors detect specific colors on the playing field. They are crucial for tasks that require the robot to follow lines or recognize colored targets. The sensors operate by emitting light and measuring the reflected color, allowing for quick and accurate color detection.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Mounted at the front of the robot, the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to nearby objects using sound waves. This capability enables the robot to avoid obstacles, adjust its path, and stop safely before colliding with any barriers.
Software Structure
The software for the robot is developed using EV3-G, the graphical programming environment for LEGO EV3, or Python with the ev3dev library. The code is organized into modular functions, promoting reusability and clarity.

Main Functions:
move_forward(speed, duration): This function controls the large motors to drive the robot forward at a specified speed for a given duration. It allows for adjusting speed dynamically based on the task requirements.
stop_robot(): This function halts all motor functions, ensuring that the robot comes to a complete stop when needed. It is particularly useful for stopping at color detection or when obstacles are detected.
detect_color(): This function reads values from the color sensors to identify colors present in the robot's vicinity. It uses conditional statements to determine the action based on the detected color, such as stopping or changing direction.
measure_distance(): This function utilizes the ultrasonic sensor to calculate the distance to the nearest object. It can trigger responses like stopping or reversing if an object is too close.
Building and Assembly Process
Assembling the Hardware:

Step 1: Begin by constructing the chassis of the robot. Securely attach the two large motors to the sides of the chassis to ensure stability during movement.
Step 2: Integrate the wheels onto the large motors, ensuring they are firmly connected for optimal drive.
Step 3: Mount the medium mechanism or attachment for tasks (if applicable) onto the chassis, connecting it to the medium motor.
Step 4: Position the two color sensors at the front and sides of the robot, angled correctly to maximize their color detection capabilities.
Step 5: Install the ultrasonic sensor at the front of the robot to optimize its ability to detect obstacles.
Connecting to the Controller:

Launch the LEGO EV3 Software to establish a connection with the robot's brick. Confirm that all motors and sensors are detected correctly within the software interface.
Assign each motor and sensor to their respective ports (e.g., Motor A and Motor B for large motors, and Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 for color sensors).
Loading the Code
Coding Environment:

Use the LEGO EV3 Software or the ev3dev Python environment for writing and editing your program. Ensure the latest version of the software is installed for full compatibility and functionality.
Uploading the Code:

After completing the code, upload it to the EV3 brick by connecting it via USB or Bluetooth. Ensure the robot is powered on during this upload process.
Test the uploaded code using the EV3 brick interface, allowing for any immediate adjustments if necessary.
Testing and Debugging:

Run the robot in a controlled environment to validate its performance. Observe how it interacts with the sensors, ensuring that it responds accurately to color detection and navigates around obstacles.
Utilize the debugging features of the programming environment to troubleshoot and optimize the code. Adjust motor speeds, sensor thresholds, and conditions to improve overall functionality.
